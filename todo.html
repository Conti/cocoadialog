<h1>TODO list</h1>
<p>
This is a to-do list for the project.  It's where I'll list things
that I plan to work on.
If you would like to help out, feel free to tackle anything here.

If you have something you would like to add to this list, or you'd
really like to see an item bumped up in priority,
<a href="mailto:mark[AT]sporkstorms.org">let me know</a>.

<h3>Sooner</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Intelligent resizing of bubbles.  If anyone wants to work on this you'll have my gratitude. ;)  Newer versions of Growl do this, but it makes it considerably more complicated than the drawing routines cocoadialog uses.</li>
	<li>Sometimes we get the following runtime warning:
		<code>__CGPixelAccessLockWindowAccess: access lock failed: error 1001.</code>
	</li>
	<li>Dialogs that time out should return values properly.
	(see <code>- (IBAction) timeout:(id)sender;</code> in CDControl/CDThreeButtonControl.m)
	</li>
	<li>Mouseover highlighting for bubbles. Either change color, or maybe make alpha=1</li>
</ul>

<h3>Later</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Countdown timer in dialogs that time out</li>
	<li>Create a <a href="http://www.gnustep.org/">GNUstep</a> port</li>
	<li>New controls <em>maybe</em>: checkbox groups, radio groups</li>
	<li>New control <em>maybe</em>: color selector.  Mostly useless though</li>
	<li>CDOptions has the limitation that a key's value cannot
	be the same as another key. For example, <code>--title --width</code>
	will not set the title to "--width".  Is this even a problem? I can't
	imagine it being one for anybody, but you never know.
	</li>
	<li>For multiple monitors, make the dialogs go to the correct screen</li>
</ul>
